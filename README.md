## Description

A TypeScript program that allows a user to search a city within the United States through the front-end and the server will grab a five day weather forecast of that city. In the five day weather forecast, the temperature will be displayed in Fahrenheit, the wind in miles-per-hour, and the humidity percentage for the city that was searched for. Previous city searches will be saved under the search bar.

## Installation

Clone the repo and type npm run start:dev in the terminal to start the program.

## Usage

Use this program to search up a city within the United States to get the weather forecast for the next five days.

## Contributing

I was able to create a weather dashboard by fetching data through the OpenWeather API.

## Tests

Npm run start:dev was utilized to open the front-end of the application to allow the user to search cities with the United States for the weather forecast for the next 5 days.
